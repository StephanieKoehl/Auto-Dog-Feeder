Open the config.txt file.

sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt

../../../_images/start07.png
Disable the automatic camera detection function.

camera_auto_detect=0

../../../_images/start08.png
Add the following instruction at the very bottom.

If you are not a Raspberry PI 5, add the following command.

dtoverlay=ov5647

../../../_images/start09.png
If you are a Raspberry PI 5, add the following command.

dtoverlay=ov5647,cam0

../../../_images/start34.png
Note:

If your camera is imx219, please change ov5647 to imx219.

If you actually connect the camera to cam1 instead of cam0, change cam0 to cam1.

Save the file and exit.

Reboot your raspberry pi.

sudo reboot

Before testing the camera, run the following command to see if the camera can be detected.

ls /dev/video*

../../../_images/start11.png
/dev/video0 indicates the camera is connected. If you do not find this device, please check the camera wiring. You may reconnect it and try again.

If the camera cannot be detected with the above two commands, please check the camera wiring. You may try reconnecting it to ensure good contact.

Always ensure that your Raspberry Pi is not powered before operating the camera wiring to avoid burning them.

rpicam-hello

You should see a camera preview window for about five seconds. If you do not, please refer to the Raspberry Pi camera documentation.

You can also enter the following command to capture an image with a resolution of 800 by 600. The image is saved in the current directory path by default.

rpicam-jpeg -o test.jpg -t 2000 --width 800 --height 600
